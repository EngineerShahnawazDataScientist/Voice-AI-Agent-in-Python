# Voice-AI-Agent-in-Python
A complete end-to-end Voice AI Agent built in Python that listens to user speech, processes it using a Large Language Model (Groq), and responds back with natural voice output. The project integrates speech recognition, LLM reasoning, and text-to-speech for real-time conversational interaction.
