# Voice-AI-Agent-in-Python
A complete end-to-end Voice AI Agent built in Python that listens to user speech, processes it using a Large Language Model (Groq), and responds back with natural voice output. The project integrates speech recognition, LLM reasoning, and text-to-speech for real-time conversational interaction.
# 🎙️ Complete Voice AI Agent

A **complete end-to-end Voice AI Agent** built using Python that can:
- Listen to human speech 🎧  
- Convert speech to text  
- Process the text using a Large Language Model (Groq) 🧠  
- Generate intelligent responses  
- Speak the response back using Text-to-Speech 🔊  

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time conversational voice assistant using modern AI tools.
